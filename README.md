PffTaskSync
===========

This is a tool to help reduce process redundancy in managing mulitple specific tools.

For our purposes, we organize our tasks in Asana, but I wanted to bring time tracking on board.

With there being enough overhead already in trying to get a team to adopt new technology, I took
the approach of trying to work with the best tool for each job.


Todo
----

1. Finish up the support in the current Providers
2. Add more Providers
3. Complete support for syncing down to tasks (currently only supports syncing down to projects)
4. Make a nice CLI and configuration to use.
5. More documentation?
